# Changelog

## [2025-07-08] - Major Implementation, Debugging, and Audit Milestone

### Added
- **Database Schema & Migrations**: Created and iteratively fixed migrations for transactions, connected accounts, escrow transactions, claims, notifications, moderation queue, push subscriptions, rate limits, and handover photos. Ensured all RLS policies are robust and idempotent.
- **Frontend Refactoring**: Renamed Profile to Dashboard, added tabs, stats cards, alerts, and Stripe Connect setup flow. Integrated BookingFlowGuard and PhotoDocumentation components for booking flow management.
- **Edge Functions**: Developed and deployed edge functions for Stripe Connect setup, webhook handling, escrow transactions, escrow release, auto-refund safeguard, email notifications, and presigned photo uploads. Fixed deployment and permission issues.
- **Stripe Connect & Escrow**: Implemented full escrow payment flow: renter pays rental + deposit (held in escrow), owner receives rental minus platform fee after rental ends, deposit refunded or claimed based on damage. Stripe Connect onboarding issues resolved by using HTTPS URLs and handling account statuses.
- **Claims System**: Added claims table, RLS, owner claim form, admin claims dashboard with approve/reject, and real-time updates. Created claim status badge in Dashboard.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Built full admin dashboard with navigation tabs for Users, Listings, Claims, Analytics, and Settings, protected by admin role. Implemented user management, verification, suspension, and moderation queue.
- **Pickup Location Feature**: Enabled owners to set pickup location after booking confirmation, with Google Maps autocomplete and lat/long storage. Embedded pickup location map in Messages.
- **Messaging Enhancements**: Refactored for real-time updates, unread badges, scam guard blocking contact info before booking confirmation, and embedded pickup location map cards.
- **Header & Navigation Redesign**: Redesigned navigation bar to include Browse, Cart, Messages, Notifications bell with dropdown, Dashboard, Admin link, and Avatar menu.
- **Notifications**: Implemented notifications dropdown with real-time subscription and mark-all-read functionality. Added pushNotificationService and service worker for push notifications.
- **Analytics Panel**: Added analytics dashboard with revenue and new user charts using Recharts.
- **Security & Rate Limiting**: Implemented global rate limiting via RLS, profanity filtering, and security monitoring. Started comprehensive security audit.
- **Photo Documentation System**: Created migrations and edge function for presigned uploads. Built PhotoDocumentation React component for uploads and progress tracking. Integrated into booking flow.
- **Testing & Audit**: Created comprehensive implementation audit document summarizing completed features, in-progress tasks, remaining tasks, database schema status, technical implementation status, performance metrics, deployment readiness, next steps, success metrics, and risk assessment.

### Fixed
- **403/406 RLS Errors**: Fixed repeated errors by recreating tables and policies, making migrations idempotent, and adjusting policies and enums.
- **Stripe Connect Onboarding**: Resolved issues by using HTTPS URLs in live mode and handling account statuses properly.
- **Migration Errors**: Made migrations idempotent and adjusted for existing policies and schema elements.
- **Docker & Edge Function Deployment**: Diagnosed and partially resolved Docker and edge function deployment issues. Cleaned up containers and restarted services.

### Known Issues
- Edge function deployment still partially blocked by Docker/container issues.
- Some API functions like `getUserReviews` and `processRefund` not yet implemented.
- Type mismatches in some components expecting different data structures.
- Legacy code patterns in some components need refactoring.
- Email service integration and push notification backend pending.

### Next Steps
- Complete edge function deployment and Docker fixes.
- Integrate email notification service and test all flows.
- Implement push notification backend and VAPID keys.
- Finish advanced analytics, photo comparison tools, and production readiness tasks.
- Continue security audit and finalize documentation.
