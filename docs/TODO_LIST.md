## üìù NOTES

- **Current Progress**: 85% complete with core functionality working
- **Blocking Issues**: Docker environment and edge function deployment
- **Critical Path**: Edge functions ‚Üí Email service ‚Üí Push notifications ‚Üí Production deployment
- **Estimated Time to Production**: 2-3 weeks with focused effort on critical items

The platform is very close to production readiness. The main blockers are infrastructure-related (Docker, edge functions) rather than feature implementation. Once these are resolved, the platform will be ready for launch.
